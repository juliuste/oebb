# oebb

Client for the [Austrian Federal Railways (Ã–BB)](https://oebb.at/) API client. Inofficial, please ask Ã–BB for permission before using this module in production. **Actually, there should be no need for projects like this since endpoints for state-owned public transportation operators should be open to the public. It's ~~2017, 2018~~ 2019. By the way: Even [Deutsche Bahn](http://www.bahn.de/) gets this now, and you don't ever want to be less progressive than them, because that would hurt their pride ðŸ˜„.**

*Still in progress*

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save oebb
```

## Usage

This package mostly returns data in the [*Friendly Public Transport Format*](https://github.com/public-transport/friendly-public-transport-format):

- [`stations(query)`](#stationsquery) - Search for stations
- [`journeys(origin, destination, date = new Date())`](#journeysorigin-destination-date--new-date) - Search for journeys between stations

### `stations(query)`

Using `oebb.stations`, you can query stations operated by Ã–BB.

```js
const stations = require('oebb').stations

stations('Wien').then(console.log)
```

Returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/promise) that will resolve in an array of `station`s in the [*Friendly Public Transport Format*](https://github.com/public-transport/friendly-public-transport-format) which looks as follows:

```js

[
    {
        "type": "station",
        "id": "1190100",
        "name": "Wien",
        "meta": true, // meta station (grouping multiple "real" stations)
        "coordinates": {
            "longitude": 16.372134,
            "latitude": 48.208547
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "station",
        "id": "1290401",
        "name": "Wien Hbf (U)",
        "meta": false,
        "coordinates": {
            "longitude": 16.375326,
            "latitude": 48.185507
        }
    },
    // â€¦
]
```

Please note that this doesn't strictly follow the FPTF requirements as some of the stations are actually meta stations rather than physical locations (like `Wien` which probably represents multiple stations). Due to the lack of additional data, there sadly was no better way to implement them though (e.g. as `regions`).

### `journeys(origin, destination, date = new Date())`

Using `oebb.journeys`, you can get directions and prices (if available) for routes from A to B.

```js
const journeys = require('oebb').journeys

journeys(origin, destination, date = new Date())

const Vienna = '8103000'
const Munich = '8000261'
const date = new Date()

journeys(Vienna, Munich, date)
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

Returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/promise) that will resolve with an array of `journey`s in the [*Friendly Public Transport Format*](https://github.com/public-transport/friendly-public-transport-format) which looks as follows.
*Note that the legs are not (fully) spec-compatible, as `schedule` is missing.*

```js
[
    {
        "type": "journey",
        "id": "fcb26082e79761ba30f4a56bb6dc9a6d36dd526b657303045a8608467d5a9f5e",
        "legs": [
            {
                "origin": {
                    "type": "station",
                    "id": "8103000",

                    "id": "8000261",

                }
